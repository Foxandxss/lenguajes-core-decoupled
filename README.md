# Lenguajes demo

This is an Angular SSR + netcore sample application.

The application composed in 3 parts:

* A backend project in netcore 2 serving an API.
* An Angular application with SSR support.
* A server for the frontend (Express) that will do the SSR stuff.

You need to run both backend and frontend to get this to work (read their readmes).
